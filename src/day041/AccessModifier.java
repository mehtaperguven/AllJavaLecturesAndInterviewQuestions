public class AccessModifier {
    //access modifiers
    //public/protected/default(no modifier)/private
    //public accessible everywhere
    //private only in the class itself


    // if we clean public from ....public void methodName()
    //it becomes... void methodName()
    //it Becomes DEFAULT ACCESS MODIFIER
    //it is only accessible with in the same package
    //in the other class importing the package
    // does not help to access if it is only void!!!!!!

    //GOOD ENCAPSULATION
    //making instance fields private
    //After that provide  public methods
