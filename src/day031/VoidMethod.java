        //it does not need external data

        Arrays.sort(your array object here);//it does not give data to store
        Arrays.deepToString(Multi dimensional array here to represent)

        OBSERVATION:
        method that accept external data when being called
        method that does not external data
        --------
        method that generate some of type of the result that can be saved
        method that does not generate data to store be stored
        ------

reusable piece of codes that
can be called many times to perform certain action
optionally return certain value of a type
